The notebooks of the exercises of the course of Algebraic Concepts in Network Theory.
The notes below can be used to install Python on your machine or even to tackle other problems beyond the scope of the present lectures.

### A (FREE!) textbook to start with:
[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

### How to write in Markdown
[MarkDown quick guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link)  
[MarkDown long guide](https://markdown-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Conda
[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html)

### Repositories
They are changing their policy, but essentially [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) gives **free** private repository, but you have to pay for public ones. Instead, [GitHub](https://github.com/) does the opposite. They both use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for managing the repositories.

### Handling difficult situations with git
They are more than you can think about... Here is a [quick tutorial](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/numerous_undo_possibilities_in_git/), here you can fine an interesting [discussions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44727750/how-do-i-restore-a-previous-version-as-a-new-commit-in-git), otherwise 
[GitHub itself tries to answer to possible issues](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/). Anyway, when everything is messed up, pray your favorite divinity and try [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).

### Jupyter
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/index.html)  
[Jupyter guide](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)  
[Jupyter extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions)  
[Jupyter configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator)

### Networks
[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html)<br/> 
[python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/) was not covered by the lectures, but really useful.

### Numpy, Scipy, Pandas
[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/ "The best module ever")<br/>
We did not used it, but [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) is part of the family of Numpy and Pandas and has submodules of statistics, equation solvers among many others...<br/>
[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#)

### Matplotlib
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html "A nightmare")  
[Matplotlib plot structure](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-usage-py "Something everyone should read more carefully every time")  
[Matplotlib colors maps](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html "Something soopercool!")

### Some tricks
The [Remote Notebook](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh) guide teaches how to use a jupyter notebook remotely from a server.<br/>
[tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is a cool way to have a progress bar in your loops<br/>
[Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html) are cool, but sometimes it's more annoying fixing them than the beauty they add to your notebook.
